## Advent of Code 2021

This repository contains solutions to the December 2021 challenges on the [Advent of Code]() website. Solutions have been written in [Rust]() because I know very little able Rust at the time that I am writing this README, and would like to learn more.

## Project Setup

Each problem solution is it's own binary. To run the puzzles, you'll need to install Rust (`rustup` is the recommended way). The development environment I used was VSCode with the official Rust Language plugin. 

## Running the Binary

The easiest way to run the individual binaries is to use the bundled tasks which can be invoked in VSCode. To run them simply use `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `B` to get a list of tasks and select which binary you want to run.

Under the hood, the tasks are simply calling `cargo run` with some other parameters.
